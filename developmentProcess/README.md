Hi, I'm Kim!

I believe web development is an iterative process and as such I will complete this assignment in small chunks and improve upon them as I go. To me, patterns emerge as I flow through the process of building a project from scratch. My goal is to wire everything up and create an MVP before refining the work.  

#Iteration One

- Using react-create-app to start project without having to configure webpack
- Built out very basic <Exchange /> component to ensure props and local state flowing correctly
- Wired up Redux for state management. Simple reducers for ui and data. Structures are very primitive and will be changed.
- Dispatching very basic actions with no payload to test that data is flowing properly through the app
- react-create-app has Jest and certain test configs already in place but I have added Enyzme to write some unit tests for components

Thoughts:
- Use JestSnapshot testing

Next Step:
